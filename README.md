List of terminologies for deeplearning

## General

**Definition**: A mechanism or module where it tells the network where to look at  
**Provenance**: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07503
### End to End
**Definition**: A network which accepts input from one end, and produces output at the other end. Opposite of "Pipeline"
### Pipeline
**Definition**: When multiple models are trained independently and then combined into a pipeline


## Computer Vision
### Activation Map
**Definition**: The 2D tensor output by a single convolution filter. AKA "Feature Map"
**See**: https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901
### Feature Map
**Definition**: Same as "Activation Map"
